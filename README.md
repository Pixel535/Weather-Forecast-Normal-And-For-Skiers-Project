# Weather Forecast For Cities And Skiers - Project

The project has been made as a part of Functional Programming course for Military University of Technology

# Description

The web application has two functions. The first one is based on OpenWeatherAPI and for a given city name the application shows current weather conditions, a 24 hour temperature graph, temperature for the next 5 days and a map zoomed to the given city name with different layers. The other function is a web-scrapping temperature for the highest mountains in the given country name. After entering a country name, the application shows radio buttons with dates. After clicking one of the buttons, the application shows a map with pins that are located on the mountain location. Users can click on the pins which will show them weather conditions for the chosen mountain on a date that has been picked.
